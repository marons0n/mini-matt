im designing a new radio for my car. 

gonna be running on a rpi 4b and a 10 inch touch screen

besides the core radio functionality (music, climate, maps, bluetooth)

the core of the project is training and implementing a custom llm

that is lightweight enough for the rpis tiny little cpu and mem.

but its called mini-matt

more to come
